3.4.1) Getting the 32-bit values J_1 and J_2

  3.4.1.1) Argon2d
    How do we get access to B with given i/j?
    Extract function begins from the right hand side, so we don't really have to know the length of B[i][j-1]?
  
  3.4.1.2) Argon2i
    Find out what is meant by each application?
    Find out what is meant by 2-round G²?
      Do we have to run it twice?
    How can we get access to the G² Function?
    Find out what is meant by counter mode?
    Find out what is exactly the output of G²?
    Find out how to code the Little Endian Function?
    Construction of the second input:
      r... is an input
      l... is given by the i input
      s... is given by the j input (code a function to find in which slice j is)
      m'??? is an input by team 5 or calculated by our own from the input m and p
      t??? is an input? is it the total number of iterations? Is a pass an iteration?
      y... is an input
      i???? WHAT THE FUCK IS I?
      Zero Block... bunch of 0's
      
   3.4.1.3) Argon2id
    if 3.4.1.1 and 3.4.1.2 is clear, this is no big deal
    Note: r must be an input, to our indexing entity because we query it
      
3.4.2) Mapping J_1 and J-2 to reference block index
  If r = 0 And s = 0 then
    i' = i
  else
    i' = J_2 mod p
  end if
  
  The next step is to get j' by getting the set W:
  
    if (j_2 mod p) = i then -- If l is the current lane
      ------
      How do we know if the last 3 segments ar computed and finished?
      How do we know if the blocks are computed in the current segment?
    else
      ------
      Same questions
    end if
    
    W should now contain many inices, how many?
      Therefore we have to know how many blocks are computed and finished!!!
      We have to know that for |W| (number of elements in W)
    calculating z should not be a problem
    W(z) is now j' (the second output)
